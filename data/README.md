# Data

The `data` folder holds files with the IDs of tweets collected as part of a number of studies. To make use of these IDs, the tweets will need to be 'hydrated' from the IDs (e.g., using a tool like [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc#hydrate))

## Dataset Descriptions

**2018 March**

The filter terms used included nine hashtags (`#abetterway`, `#ausunions`, `#realchange`, `#saelection`, `#saparli`, `#sapol`, `#savotes`, `#savotes2018`, `#liberals`) and the screen names of 134 political candidate and party accounts (and are withheld to comply with ethics protocol H-2018-045 approved by the University of Adelaide's human research and ethics committee, but can be provided on request).

**Persistent Echo Chambers**

This study examined the activites and content of two pairs of polarised groups (the ArsonEmergency groups and a second pair active during Australia's marriage equality postal survey in 2017) over a longitudinal setting, through three Twitter datasets covering different discussion topics.

- `ArsonEmergency-20191231-20200117-tweet_ids.txt.gz`: Twitter activity including the keyword 'ArsonEmergency' 2019-12-31 to 2020-01-17
- `ssm-original-tweet_ids.txt.gz`: Twitter activity collected from September to November 2017 relating to the Australian marriage equality (same-sex marriage, SSM) postal survey using the keywords '\#MarriageEquality', '\#SSM', '\#auspol', '\#VoteYes', and '\#VoteNo', in which the users of \#VoteYes and \#VoteNo were found to be clearly polarised.
- `ssm-election-tweet_ids.txt.gz`: The activities of the \#VoteYes and \#VoteNo accounts in the three weeks leading up to and just past the Australian federal election in May 2019.
- `afl-rapid-20190322_25-tweet_ids.txt.gz`: A 72 hour collection of discussion surrounding the Australian Football League (AFL) sports competition (keyword: 'afl').

These datasets were used in the following publications:

- Mehwish Nasim, Derek Weber, Tobin South, Jonathan Tuke, Nigel Bean, Lucia Falzon and Lewis Mitchell (in preparation), "A longitudinal study of the echo chamber effect in the Australian Twittersphere".
