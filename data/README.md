# Data

The `data` folder holds files with the IDs of tweets collected as part of a number of studies. To make use of these IDs, the tweets will need to be 'hydrated' from the IDs (e.g., using a tool like [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc#hydrate))

## Dataset Descriptions

The filter terms used included nine hashtags (`#abetterway`, `#ausunions`, `#realchange`, `#saelection`, `#saparli`, `#sapol`, `#savotes`, `#savotes2018`, `#liberals`) and the screen names of 134 political candidate and party accounts (and are withheld to comply with ethics protocol H-2018-045 approved by the University of Adelaide's human research and ethics committee, but can be provided on request).
